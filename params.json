{"name":"Connect","tagline":"Java-Based web interface library designed to make interfaces a snap to create.","body":"### Connect\r\nConnect is a Java library for creating Web-Based Interfaces, think of it as JFrame for the web. It was created in Late October 2015, and is maintained by [@notelek](https://twitter.com/notelek).\r\n\r\n## Easy Interface Creation\r\nCreating an interface can be a challenging aspect of program design, and take up valuable time that could be spent working on your solution, with Connect, all you have to do is import the library, and in as little as 2 lines of code you can have your own web based interface up and running.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nIn two simple lines of java, you can create the base for your interface, doing away with the hassle of setting up a web server, linking imports, and referencing documentation.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nLayout layout = new Layout();\r\nPortListener server = new PortListener(80, layout.generateDashboard(\"Notelek Connect\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example creates the basic page below:\r\n![Connect Demo Page](http://i.imgur.com/nusC9yN.png)\r\n\r\nWhere more granular control is required, you can begin to use the deeper functions of connect. Below is the same example as above, but in expanded form.\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nPageBuilder page = new PageBuilder();\r\npage.addNavbar(title, new String[] {\"Dashboard\", \"Logs\", \"Settings\"});\r\npage.addContent(\"<div style=\\\"font-size:32pt;text-align:center;width:500px;position:absolute;top:30%;left:50%;margin-left:-250px;\\\">Dashboard Demo</div>\");\r\nString pageContent = page.getPage(title);\r\n```","google":"UA-52803605-7","note":"Don't delete this file!
